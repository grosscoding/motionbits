# Blur Text

The Blur Text component creates an engaging text reveal animation with a blur effect. Text elements (words or individual letters) appear with a smooth transition from blurred to sharp, creating a dynamic and attention-grabbing effect.

## Features

- Animate text by words or individual letters
- Configurable animation direction (top or bottom)
- Intersection Observer integration for scroll-triggered animations
- Customizable animation timing and easing

## Example

<BlurText text="This text animates with a blur effect" />

## Usage

```astro
---
import BlurText from '../components/blur-text.astro';
---

<BlurText text="Your text here" />
```

## Technical Details

The Blur Text component uses the Motion Dev animation library and Intersection Observer API to create smooth, performant animations that only trigger when the component enters the viewport.
